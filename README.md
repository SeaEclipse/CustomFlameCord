# Issues
If you encounter issues report them, if you are a developer I'll glad to see you contributing to the project by releasing fixes.

# Patch infos
Just pickup Travertine's original file and extract classes from FlameCord's jar file and then do: "jar uf Travertine.jar net/*" "jar uf Travertine.jar com/*" 

SPARK-Patch will be always up to date, it contains patched BungeeCord.class for being modified, TravertineSemiPatch.jar
contains only edu.* annotations update, no BungeeCord.class patch!
